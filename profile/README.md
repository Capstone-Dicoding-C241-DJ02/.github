## Overview
<div>
  <p align="justify";>Dicoding Jobs is a platform designed to connect recruiters with potential candidates, but the challenge is to efficiently recommend the best candidates among the overwhelming number of resumes received for each job opening. To solve this problem, the project aims to develop machine learning driven features. The minimum viable product (MVP) will include an automated CV summarization for quick analysis, a candidate ranking system based on pre-defined criteria to prioritize candidates, and a recommendation system that suggests candidates in line with the preferences of the organization. Research underscores the critical role of resume screening in recruiting (Cable & Judge, 1997; Higgins & Judge, 2004) and highlights the need for automated tools to streamline the selection process and ensure recruiters can efficiently identify the most suitable candidates.</p>
